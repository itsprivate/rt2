I work for a small business who put huge emphasis on everyone being friends and building a strong team, but it just means it hurts more when someone inevitably stabs you in the back. I&#39;m not saying go around and be a dick to people for no reason, but it&#39;s better to build relationships outside of work or in places where there aren&#39;t any politics or power imbalances.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Wow I didn&#39;t expect this to blow up and there&#39;s too many comments now for me to keep up with. It&#39;s kind of vindicating but also sad that so many people feel the same or have had similar negative experiences. For the &quot;my workplace isn&#39;t like this&quot; and &quot;my co-workers are my family&quot; people - I hope it stays that way for you, I really do, but I&#39;d maybe read some of the stories on this comment thread and be wary.

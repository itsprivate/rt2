Because it’s not.</p>\n\n<p>We also know they’re down BAD. Why?\nBecause they’re attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.</p>\n\n<p>So let’s see what tactics they are using:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Short ladder attacks</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>What is a short ladder attack? \nThe big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it &quot;looks&quot; like the stock is plummeting. It’s only effective if we would sell. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ay2s/short_ladder_attack_explained/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9ay2s/short_ladder_attack_explained/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6vcb/wall_street_plan_trying_to_psychologically_scare/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n\n<p>Just look at the volume.

Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There’s tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahqex/notice_the_two_obvious_melvin_employees_time_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahqex/notice_the_two_obvious_melvin_employees_time_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Manipulating the Media</strong>: </p>\n\n<p>Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8n7o/fake_news/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8n7o/fake_news/</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6e16/cnn_back_off_this_is_a_lie_literally_a_5_second/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la6e16/cnn_back_off_this_is_a_lie_literally_a_5_second/</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8x7g/bloomberg_now_insisting_gme_is_old_news_ha/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la8x7g/bloomberg_now_insisting_gme_is_old_news_ha/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n\n<p>Now let’s get some clarification on <strong>SILVER:</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don’t seem to realize 3 things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.</strong> GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO) </li>\n<li>The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make. </li>\n<li>The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that’s why they’re pushing this narrative in the media. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>SLV inverting GME: \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n\n<p>The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IF</strong> you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that’s just my retard opinion. </p>\n\n<p><strong>SILVER ISN’T “REDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY“.</strong> You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.</p>\n\n<p>Silver squeeze not happening links: \n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1o04/there_is_no_silver_short_squeeze_happening_none/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1o04/there_is_no_silver_short_squeeze_happening_none/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess_who_owns_tonnes_of_slv_options_fuck_citadel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la1xhf/guess_who_owns_tonnes_of_slv_options_fuck_citadel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9runf/the_silver_squeeze_is_a_hedgefund_coordinated/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n\n<p>Well. Let’s see to what extend they fucked up exactly: </p>\n\n<p><strong>Short Version:</strong>\nThe short version is that a review of the <strong>&#39;strategic fails–to–deliver&#39;</strong> data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>There are are <strong>71 million shares</strong> of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than <strong>102,000,000</strong> shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.</p>\n\n<p>On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  </p>\n\n<p>Once you include call options, <strong>retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)</strong>. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.</p>\n\n<p>Long version here: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\">https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>At these levels it’s NOT about the price, it’s about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That’s why they want you to sell so bad.</strong></p>\n\n<p>🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎</p>\n\n<p>Last but not least I’m holding because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
